# Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of:

- Spatial Statistics
- Bayesian Modelling
- Causal Inference

I currently work on novel ways to respresnt spatial pattern in disease risk in the context of the Glasgow Effect.
I am also interested to work with models that can help inform health policies and combat health inequalities.
