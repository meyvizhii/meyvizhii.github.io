# Outreach

I like doodling to escape fixing bugs in my code. Some of these doodles are based on science to explain away the time I spend on them.

Glasgow PG Seminars 2024-2025
---
As PhD students here, we took an oath to always talk about math. Especially for the important cause of having fun. The [Glasgow PG Seminars](https://sites.google.com/view/pgseminar/home) has been the home to one such weekly set of talks. Some drawings from my first term attending them can be [found here](https://sites.google.com/view/pgseminar/art-work). The next term's artworks are [linked here](\files\pg_seminars_may_2025.pptx).

Fisher's Fishes

Designed a logo for the lovely community at [Fisher's Fishes](https://fishersfishes.github.io/). A journal club for theoretical bio, the logo is based on petri dish cultures of a p.vortex bacterial colony.
