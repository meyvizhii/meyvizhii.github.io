Hello! I am a first-year PhD candidate in the School of Mathematics and Statistics, at [UoG](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/). With a focus on disease risk mapping, I am working with spatial and spatio-temporal models at UoG to help answer important questions on health outcome inequalities. With previous experience in [infectious disease modelling](https://sites.google.com/math.iith.ac.in/sayanteejana/team-members), I now work on chronic diseases risks. My undergrad was a BSc Statistics and Mathematics where I was able to explore both theory and applications.

Passionate about science outreach, I also help coordinate talks and workshops as a co-organizer of the [R-Ladies Bangalore](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-bangalore/?msockid=249ea3195d2e6f811d22b60a5c546e13) chapter. Caricature-ising technical research into digestible cartoons is another way I attempt to engage with science [outreach](\_pages\portfolio.html). More information on my backkground can be found in my [CV](\files\Meyvizhi_CV.pdf).

I am always open to hearing about cool science, books ([A Man Called Ove](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18774964-a-man-called-ove) is a good read) and food+restaurant reccomendations([Masala Dosa](https://centraltiffinroom.com/) and [Napoli](https://www.santaluciaglasgow.com/))!
