Hello! I'm **Meyvizhi**- a 1st-year PhD candidate in the School of Mathematics and Statistics, at [UoG](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/). I am jointly supervised by [Dr. Craig Anderson](https://sites.google.com/view/craiganderson/home), [Dr. Vanessa McNealis](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/staff/vanessamcnealis/) and [Dr. Daniela Castro-Camilo](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/staff/danielacastrocamilo/).

With a focus on disease risk mapping, I am working on spatial models to help answer important questions on health outcome inequalities. With [previous experience](https://sites.google.com/math.iith.ac.in/sayanteejana/team-members) in infectious disease modelling, I now work on chronic diseases risks. Previous academic experience is a Bachelors in Statistics and Mathematics, which allowed me to explore both theory and applications.

Passionate about science outreach, I also help coordinate talks and workshops as a co-organizer of the [R-Ladies Bangalore](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-bangalore/?msockid=249ea3195d2e6f811d22b60a5c546e13) chapter. Caricature-ising technical research into digestible cartoons is another way I attempt to engage with science outreach. More information on my background can be found in my [CV](\Meyvizhi_CV_July25.pdf).

I am always open to hearing about cool science, books ([A Man Called Ove](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18774964-a-man-called-ove) is a good read) and food reccomendations([Masala Dosas](https://centraltiffinroom.com/))!
